            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the twentith verſe of this Chapter, the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt telleth vs, that the two ſonnes of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedeus</hi> came with their Mother to our Sauiour Chriſt, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting this fauour of him, <hi>That the one of them might ſit at his right hand, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6379:5"/>
the other at his left hand in his kingdom.</hi> Our Sauiour had fore-told them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before,<note place="margin">Ver. 18, 19.</note> that his death was now at hand, and that he ſhould riſe againe the third day. Whereupon, they by and by thought, that preſently after his reſurrection, hee would begin his kingdome in the earth: which they imagined (as the reſt of the <hi>Iewes</hi> did) ſhould be a temporall Kingdom, like the kingdomes of this worlde. Our Sauiour had alſo promiſed all the twelue, that when he ſhould ſit in the <hi>Throne of his Maieſty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 19, 28.</note> 
               <hi>they ſhould ſit alſo vpon twelue thrones, and iudge the</hi> 12 <hi>Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> And therefore, theſe two Diſciples being ſtill carnally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, make this requeſt, that they may haue the chiefe places of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and authority next vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For they ſaw that our Sauiour reſpected them aboue the reſt, and that he vſed them more familiarly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fellowes. Onely they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide leſt <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould bee preferred before them. For they ſaw that our Sauiour graced him alſo, &amp; that when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6379:5"/>
any ſpecial worke was to be wroght, hee was admitted to bee preſent at it as well as they. As when he was <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured on the Mountaine, he tooke Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 17, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and Iames, and Iohn</hi> vp with him, and left the reſt of his Diſciples below. And when hee raiſed vppe <hi>Iairus</hi> his daughter,<note place="margin">Marke 5, 37.</note> 
               <hi>hee ſuffered no man to follow him, ſaue Peter, and Iames, &amp; Iohn.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they had heard our Sauior make a promiſe vnto <hi>Peter</hi> (though, if they vnderſtood it aright, it was made to them all as well as to him) <hi>That hee would giue vnto him the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore,<note place="margin">Math. 16, 19.</note> they labour here to preuent him, that he may not be aduanced aboue them. Now it is worth the noting that they do not moue their ſuite in their owne perſonnes, but ſet their Mother on worke to bee a Mediator for them: which they did, it may bee, becauſe they were baſhfull; and (as it is with many men in this caſe) were loath to ſay their owne errand; but chiefely, becauſe they hoped y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by this meanes their ſuit would be the better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6379:6"/>
For they knew ſhe was very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with our Sauiour, being one of thoſe women which <hi>followed him from Galile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27, 55, 56</note> 
               <hi>and miniſtred vnto him.</hi> And therefore they hoped, that if ſhee ſhould moue their requeſt, he would not giue it the repulſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 22, 23.</note>Well, our Sauiour notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vtterly denieth and reiecteth their ſuite; and thereupon, there is kindled a new flame among the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. For it is ſaid, <hi>that the other ten diſdained the two Brethren;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> not becauſe they deteſted their fact as carnall, but becauſe they alſo were carried with ambition, and gaped after the ſame preferment, and deſired to bee emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Kingdome of Chriſt; and therefore they thought it would bee an iniury to all the reſt, if the cheefe rule and gouernment ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon a few. So that as the two brethren offended with blinde ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo the other tenne offended no leſſe with ambitious indignation. As they did carnally make this requeſt; ſo theſe did as carnally diſdain them,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6379:6"/>
ſeeing euery one of them did no leſſe deſire the cheefeſt place,<note place="margin">Luke 9, 46. Mar. 9, 34.</note> as appeareth by their manifolde contentions and diſputations about it. But our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as by his wonted mildeneſſe and clemency he tollerated the carnal pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the two brethren: ſo he doth not ſharpely reprooue the carnall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the reſt.<note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> But calling them all vnto him, as if hee had had ſome ſerious matter to impart, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to cure them all with one Medicine, and hereby taketh occaſion to exhort them to humility and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of mind, and that by two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary examples. The one is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Kings of the earth, from whom he would haue his Diſciples to differ the other is his owne example,<note place="margin">Ver. 25, 26.</note> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they ought to conform themſelues if they deſire to reigne with him. The former example is firſt propounded in theſe words; <hi>Ye know that the Lords of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, &amp; they that are great exerciſe authority ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> And afterward it is expounded in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6379:7"/>
next words,<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note>

And to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might affect them the more, &amp; make better impreſſion of his doctrine, he addeth another ſentence,<note place="margin">Verſe 27.</note> ſaying; <hi>Whoſoeuer wil be chiefe among you, let him bee your ſeruant.</hi> Where he teacheth vs how a man may be great, and the chiefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the kingdom of heauen; namely, if he ſubiect himſelf to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter &amp; to do ſeruice to al men: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Ierom</hi> ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtus humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis magiſter, &amp;c ad locum.</note>

As if our Sauior ſhold haue ſaid, our eſtate is not like the eſtate of ſtrangers. For among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they that are princes do bear rule; but with mee, he that is the laſt is the cheefeſt. But there are others that wil haue the meaning of the ſpeech thus: that our Sauiour teacheth in this place, how he that hath attained rule &amp; authority in the church, ought to behaue himſelfe in the ſame; namely, if he will execute his office wel, he muſt be the miniſter and ſeruant of them ouer whom he is ſet, ſo as in all things he ſeek their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit &amp; ſaluation, &amp; not his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.

ſuperiority,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.24.25 26.27.</note> 
               <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles reigne ouer them, and they that bear rule ouer them are called gracious Lords. But ye ſhall not be ſo: but let the greateſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you be as the leaſt: and the cheefeſt as hee that ſerueth. For who is greater, hee that ſitteth at table, or he that ſerueth? Is not he that ſitteth at Table? And I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you as he that ſerueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The example of our Sauior Chriſt is ſet downe in this verſe that I haue read. There are no arguments that preuaile more with Schollers &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, then the example of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And therefore as Chriſt doeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where vrge and preſſe it, that they might in it as in a glaſſe ſee how to conforme themſelues: ſo heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to his precept he addeth his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he might the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moue them. Now this example is firſt propounded generally, in theſe words, <hi>The Sonne of man came not to be miniſtred vnto, but to miniſter.</hi> As if hee ſhould haue ſaide; If I had come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world in any ſuch pompe, as to beare rule like an earthly King, and to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6379:8"/>
bee guarded with a troope of manie ſeruants, then it would bee no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if your mindes were enflamed &amp; ſet on fire with ambition, and that you ſhould alſo conceyue haughtie thoughts. For then there would bee ſome reaſon that my followers ſhould contend for ſuperiority; &amp; it would be a neceſſary queſtion, who ſhould beare rule, and who ſhould obey. But you your ſelues do ſee, how I am come in the forme of a ſeruant, to doe ſeruice for the good of all men. And therefore, what excuſe can you haue, if neglecting my example, whereby I miniſter vnto others, you deſire to beare rule ouer others? For you ſhold alwayes remember that which I haue ſo often ſaide vnto you: <hi>The Diſciple is not aboue his Maſter, nor the ſeruant aboue his Lord. It is enough for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be as his maſter is, and the ſeruant as his Lord.</hi> And heerein we haue to conſider two things.

               <hi>[The Sonne of man.]</hi> This title is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie where appropriated to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> in the <hi>new Teſtament.</hi> And it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Prophet deſcribeth the

There bee diuers Reaſons why this name is giuen vnto him. Some ſay, he was ſo called becauſe he had no Father, but was the Sonne of the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> as it were of one man.

Firſt, hee was called the <hi>Sonne of Man,</hi> becauſe hee was a true man like vnto vs in all thinges except ſinne. For, being the Sonne of GOD, he could haue created his humane fleſh of the earth, as the body of <hi>Adam</hi> was formed; but becauſe he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6379:10"/>
would make it appeare, that hee did truly take our Nature vpon him, hee tooke his fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> and ſo was not only man, but the <hi>Son of Man.</hi> And indeed our Sauiour was very man, conſiſting of a true reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, and a true ſubſtantial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like vnto other men, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth manifeſtly declare. <hi>There is one Mediator</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene GOD and man,</hi>

               </note> is contained the whole fulneſſe of the myſterie of our ſaluation.

And this the Euangeliſt plainly teacheth, when hee ſaieth of <hi>Ieſus</hi> beeing yet a childe, <hi>That he grew, and waxed ſtrong in Spirit, and was filled with wiſdom, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>He increaſed in Wiſedome and ſtature.</hi> As it is proper vnto the fleſh, to grow in ſtature; ſo it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſoule to increaſe in Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Grace.

baſe forme of a ſeruant. He was born in a ſtable, becauſe there was no room for him in the Inne; and he was laide in a cratch,<note place="margin">Luke 2, ver. 7</note> for want of a better cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. And as his comming into the world was thus poore and baſe; ſo all the while that he liued amongſt men, he did vtterly refuſe all outwarde ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and authority, as appeareth in many inſtances.

For ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons doe eie and obſerue both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6379:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their inferiours, and alſo their equals and ſuperiors. Such as they thinke to bee any way vnder them, thoſe they contemne, and reprochfully diſgrace, and importunately prouoke with wrongs and iniuries.<note place="margin">Eſter 3, 5, 6.</note> So did proud <hi>Haman</hi> deſpiſe and contemne poore <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and wrought all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe againſt him that he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. And ſuch an one was <hi>Diotrephes</hi> in the Primitiue Church,<note place="margin">3 Ioh. ve. 9, 10</note> who <hi>louing to haue the preheminence among them, receyued not the Apoſtles, but pratled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them with malicious wordes, and was iniurious to the Saintes, thruſting them out of the Church.</hi> For ſuch is the corruption of our nature, that when a man is once aduanced aboue others according to the old Prouerbe, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor changeth his manners, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him become proud and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

For this is our natural affection &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6379:16"/>
that euery man is highlie conceited of himſelfe, and euery man thinketh himſelf worthy of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and greateſt honor, and therefore enuieth all that are aduanced aboue them. As wee ſee in the ſons of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 37, 11.</note> who wer diſpleaſed when they heard that their brother <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was like to be preferred before them. But what elſe doe theſe perſons by enuying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but torment themſelues? For, this is the nature of enuy, that it do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſo much hurt another, as it vexeth and greeueth it ſelfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith well,<note n="*" place="margin">O ambitio ambientium crux! quomodo omnes torquens, omnibus places? &amp;c. de conſid. lib. <hi>3.</hi>

            <p>And therefore we are heere to bee exhorted and admoniſhed, to ſubdue this immoderate affection in vs by all meanes poſſible, and not ſuffer it to breake out in this manner.

For as one ſaith well, He that deſireth ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and preferment, he doth it becauſe he knoweth not himſelfe. Now both by our originall, and by our reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are no better then earth. Of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6379:26"/>
the earth we were framed, and to the earth wee muſt returne. It was the doome of <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, and in him of all mankinde; <hi>Duſt thou art,</hi>

               <hi>&amp; to duſt thou ſhalt returne.</hi> And therfore, what a ſhame is it, that ſuch baſe creatures ſhould conceiue ſuch high thoughts, and nouriſh ſuch haughtie ſpirites? As the mountaines ſeeme to bee high, and yet they are but earth, and haue their foundation below: ſo ambitious perſons when they are at their greateſt height, they are but earth, nay as <hi>Abraham</hi> confeſſed of himſelfe, they are but <hi>duſt and aſhes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneſ. 18, 27</note> The conſideration of this ſhold nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vs to humility, and keep vs from aſpiring too high. And indeed, if the proud hearts could be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, the beſt and readieſt way to come to preferment, is by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. As our Sauiour Chriſt told the Iewes, when hee marked how they choſe out the cheefe roomes, <hi>Hee that humbleth himſelfe ſhall be exalted.</hi> And we ſee it in our owne experience, that honor accompanieth none more then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6379:27"/>
ſuch as leaſt deſire it. And therefore it is fitly compared to the ſhadow of a mans body,<note n="*" place="margin">Gloria fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes magis ac magis ſequitur Sen. beneſ. lib. <hi>5</hi>
               </note> which, if hee follow after it, it goeth away from him, but if he runne from it, it followeth after him. So if men do eagerly purſue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour, many times they come ſhort of it, but if they neglect it, and be careleſſe of it, God will cauſe <hi>the Spirit of glory to reſt vpon them</hi> vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4, 14.</note> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. Yea, many haue beene had in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great honour after their death, that haue refuſed all honour while they liued.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, here is a good admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all that that are aduanced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honour, not to bee puffed vp with their preferment, but carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues lowly, towards their inferiors, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exhortation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.<note place="margin">Rom. 12, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Be not high minded; but make your ſelues equall to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lower ſort.</hi> And great reaſon there is, why it ſhould be ſo. For as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Haue we not all one Father?</hi>

               <hi>hath not one God made vs all?</hi> and that al of one mould.

If he had made great perſons of one kinde of mould, &amp; meane perſons of another; then there had bin ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for them to ſwell in pride, and to lift vp themſelues aboue others. But ſeeing GOD hath made all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde of one blood,<note place="margin">Acts 17, 26.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, it is not meete that one ſhould proudly inſult ouer another. Yea, which is more, <hi>we were all in the hands of God,</hi>

               <hi>as the clay is in the hands of the Potter.</hi> And as that which is now a veſſell of honour, the Potter could haue made it a veſſell of baſer vſe: and that which is now a veſſell of diſhonour, hee could haue made it a veſſell of honour.

               <hi>and not to ſwel one against another,</hi> like bladders that are full of winde: he addeth this as a forcible argument to conuince their conſciences. <hi>For who ſeparateth thee? and what hast thou that thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> 
               <hi>If thou haſt receiued it, why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceſt thou, as though thou hadst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it?</hi> Where wee ſee, he would haue ſuch proude perſons to deſcend into themſelues, and examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thoroughly, and ſee whether they finde any matter of inſolency in themſelues, or no. As if he ſhold haue ſaid, There is no reaſon why ye ſhould ſwell one againſt another; becauſe, if you be ſeparated from your brethren in any reſpect, it is onely GOD that hath put the difference: for by nature you are no better then they. If you conſider the nature of them whome you do deſpiſe, they are men, as your ſelues are, indued with reaſon, made after the image of God, and ſprung
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6379:28"/>
from <hi>Adam.</hi> And if you conſider their condition, they are ſinners, they are the children of wrath, and ſubiect to eternall damnation. And is not your condition the ſame? why then ſhould you lift vp your ſelues? And leſt anie man ſhould obiect, that there is great difference of men in the world; ſome are noble, ſome ignoble; ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſome vnlearned; ſome Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſome Subiectes: ſome rich, ſome poore: therefore hee addeth, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?</hi> Namely, of Gods free grace &amp; mercy. He that receiueth any thing of duty, and not of grace, may in ſome ſort reioyce: but he that glorieth in a free gift, is vaine and vnthankefull.

               <hi>[But to ſerue.]</hi> Heere wee ſee what was indeede the end of our Sauiour Chriſts comming. He came to doe ſeruice to his Church, and in al things to apply himſelfe vnto the benefite of all men. Hee taught the people, as a Miniſter of the word; he healed their diſeaſes; and for this cauſe he walked
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6379:29"/>
about corporally, through diuers Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and countries, not for his owne profit or glory, but onely for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of others. For, as hee was <hi>annointed</hi> by his Father,<note place="margin">Luke 4, 18.</note> and <hi>ſent to preach the Gospell to the poore:</hi> ſo hee taught continually <hi>in their Synagogues.</hi>
               <note place="margin">15.</note> And therefore he ſaid to his diſciples,<note place="margin">Marke 1, 38.</note> 
               <hi>Let vs go into the next Townes, that I may preach there alſo: for I came out for that purpoſe.</hi> And the Euangeliſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of him, <hi>that he went about al Cities &amp; Townes, teaching in their ſynagogues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9, 35. and 4, 23.</note> 
               <hi>and preaching the Goſpel of the kingdom, and healing euery ſickneſſe, and euerie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe among the people.</hi> For no doubt, but this place is chiefly vnderſtoode of the miniſtery and ſeruice which he performed in ſpirituall things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith, he came to ſerue in ſuch a Miniſtery, as wherein he wold haue his Apoſtles to imitate him: thogh we may alſo vnderſtand it of his miniſtry in temporall things; as when he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe to waſh their feete. As S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he riſeth from ſupper,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 13, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and layeth aſide his vpper gurment, and

tooke a Towell, and girded himſelfe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he poured water into a baſin, &amp; began to waſh the diſciples feete, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith hee was girded.</hi> Where it is woorth the noting, that the Euangeliſt doeth ſo exactly ſet downe this action of our Sauiour Chriſt. He might haue ſayde briefly, that he waſhed his Diſciples feete. But to the end, that hee might more deepely imprint in our mindes this admirable humility, he is careful to expreſſe euery circumſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that we might (as it were) behold it with our eies. Giuing vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,<note place="margin">Muſculus ad locum.</note> that our Sauiour did not ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe this duty, as though hee cared not how ſoone hee were rid of it, but carefully and diligently: yea, he performed all with his own hands and had not another to do it for him: that ſo hee might euery way expreſſe to his Diſciples the form of a ſeruant, whereunto theſe ſeruile Offices doe appertaine. It is not ſaide, that the Apoſtles did riſe alſo, but that Chriſt onely did riſe, and they ſate ſtill at the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6379:30"/>
Table. According to that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith in another place;<note place="margin">Luke 22, 27.</note> 
               <hi>Who is greater, he that ſitteth at table, or he that ſerueth? Is not he that ſitteth at Table? And I am amongst you as he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this doth ſet out the great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of our Sauiour Chriſt: ſo it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commendeth his ſingular loue to vs, that hee would bee pleaſed in this manner to reſpect ſuch poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as we are. For wee might euerie one of vs ſay,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 9, 8.</note> as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dauid, What is thy ſeruant, that thou ſhouldeſt looke vpon ſuch a dead dogge as I am?</hi> If an earthly King ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point one of the Nobles of his Court to attend vpon ſome poore deſpiſed perſon, as the great King <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> commanded <hi>Haman,</hi> the moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all his Court,<note place="margin">Eſter 6, 10, 11</note> to attend and waite vpon poore <hi>Mordecai,</hi> it were a token of great loue: but if the King himſelfe ſhall lay by his Princely robes, and put on baſe apparrell, and ſo ſhall in his owne perſon performe euery baſe office to a poore begger
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6379:31"/>
that lieth at his gates, it would bee a wonderfull ſpectacle, worthy to bee chronicled and regiſtred to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In like manner, if the Lorde had appointed any of his Angels, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Court of heauen (as I may call them <hi>who are miniſtring ſpirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1, 14.</note> 
               <hi>ſent forth to miniſter for their ſakes, which ſhall be heires of ſaluation</hi>) to attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, it had bene exceeding Loue, conſidering our baſe and wretched eſtate: But, that hee himſelfe, the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19, 16 Math. 28, 18</note> 
               <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords, who hath receiued all power from his Father in Heauen and earth,</hi> ſhould not onely ſtrip himſelfe of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which hee had in heauen, and to take our Nature vpon him; but alſo take vppon him the baſe forme of a ſeruant, and therein do ſeruice vnto vs, it is a loue ſurpaſſing all loue, and therefore ſhould cauſe vs to loue him againe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this example is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for our imitation. As our Sauiour himſelfe applyeth it; when hauing waſhed his Diſciples feete,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6379:31"/>
and taken his Garments, and beeing ſet downe againe, he ſaid vnto them; <hi>Know yee what I haue done to you?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 13, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Ye call mee Maſter, and Lord: and yee ſay well: for ſo I am. If I then your Lord and Maſter, haue waſhed your feete, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers Feete. For I haue giuen you an example, that yee ſhould doe, euen as I haue done vnto you.</hi> And this is alſo the exhortation of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 5, 6, 7</note> 
               <hi>Let the ſame minde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be in you, that was in Christ Ieſus.</hi> Now, what mind was in him? Why (as wee haue heard) hee layde by his Maieſty and glory that hee had with his Father, and for our ſakes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed himſelfe to the loweſt degree of humiliation that could be. So muſt we, as much as lyeth in vs, apply our ſelues to the good one of another. Wee muſt lay by our greatneſſe, and <hi>ſerue one another by Loue.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Galath. 5, 13.</note> as hee exhorteth others: ſo him-ſelfe did carefully practiſe this Dutie. <hi>Though hee were free from all men, yet hee made himſelfe a Seruant vnto all men, that he might winne the more.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 19, 20 21, 22.</note>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:6379:32"/>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Iewes he became as a Iew, that he might winne the Iewes: to them that were vnder the Law, as though hee were vnder the Law: to them that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law, as if hee were without the Law. To the weake, he became as weake.</hi> In a word, <hi>He was made all things to al men, that he might by all meanes ſaue ſome.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide, I am in all things free, and may liue as I liſt: yet haue I willingly ſubiected my ſelfe to all ſorts of men. For, to becom a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, is to liue at the pleaſure &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of another, and not to be his owne man. Thus the Apoſtle ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth himſelf exceeding humble, who as though he were the meaneſt of all, was ready to performe his ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, as if they had bene his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. If ſo great an Apoſtle did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelfe thus low, let vs thinke what is meete for vs to do. Wee muſt not ſpare for any difficulties, but by the example of the Apoſtle, become all thinges to all men, though it bee with the loſſe of our liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. It was a good ſpeech of one of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6379:32"/>
Chriſtian Emperors,<note n="*" place="margin">Luitprand. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> That hee reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more gloriouſly, that ſerueth the baſe eſtate of Gods ſeruants, then he that ruleth ouer the greateſt ſinners in the world. But to the end we may be the more willing to performe this duty, let vs a little neerer examine this example of our Sauiour Chriſt. And in it, let vs conſider, firſt, who it was that in this manner humbled himſelf, and that is, the onely begotten Sonne of God, who is Lord of heauen and earth. Secondly, how farre hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe: euen vnto death, and that the moſt ſhamefull death of the croſſe. Thirdly, for whom he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe, euen for ſinners and wicked perſons, as the apoſtle ſaith; <hi>When we were ſinners, Chriſt dyed for vs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 5.8.</note> Ther could not any thing be propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more forcibly againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pride of our nature, then this example. It may bee thou art a great man, a Learned man, a wiſe man, a noble man, a rich man, a mighty man; &amp; therefore thou thinkſt it would be a diſgrace to thee to do ſeruice vnto others. But thou
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6379:33"/>
art not greater, nor learneder, nor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, nor nobler, nor richer, nor migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, then our Sauiour Chriſt was. It may bee thou art diſcouraged by the baſeneſſe of the ſeruice which thou muſt performe. But what euer was more baſe and vile in the world, then the death of the Croſſe? It may bee thou conſidereſt the baſeneſſe of them to whom thou art to doe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and compareſt it with thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo thinkeſt it ſome diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto thee. If it were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome kind office of loue for one of thine owne ranke, thou wouldeſt not ſtand vpon it. But to ſtoop ſo low as to do ſeruice to euery mean perſon, thou thinkeſt it cannot ſtande with thy reputation. But what is more vile and abiect, beeing compared vnto God, then wicked ſinners, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and ſubiect to eternall deſtruction? So that, to conclude this point; by vertue of this example of our Sauiour Chriſt, there is no man liuing, though hee be neuer ſo great and honourable, that ſhould refuſe to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6379:33"/>
do any thing, though it bee neuer ſo baſe, for any man, though hee be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo abiect, if his neceſſitie doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[His Life.]</hi> Thus wee haue heard the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, as it hath beene generally propounded. Now, followeth the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Humility, whereby it is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified and ſet out; which was, <hi>To giue his Life a ranſome for many.</hi> In the firſt circumſtance whereof, wee are taught what is the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The Apoſtle telleth vs,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 19, 20</note> that <hi>Wee are not our owne, for wee are bought with a price.</hi> And this price, as another Apoſtle ſayeth,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 18, 19</note> 
               <hi>Was not Siluer and Golde, or ſuch like corruptible thing:</hi> they were all too baſe to come in this accompt; but, <hi>The precious blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">and 2, 24.</note> And ſo hee ſaith in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>That his owne ſelfe, bare our ſinnes in his body on the Tree.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, Epheſ. 1.17.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1, ver. 5</note> That <hi>by him wee haue redemption through his blood.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 12,</note> 
               <hi>By his owne bloud hee obtained eternall Redemption for vs.</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:6379:34"/>
And, <hi>Without ſhedding of blood is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> But it will be obiected; what neceſſity was there that our Sauiour ſhould pay any price or ranſome, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were priſoners to the deuil? A man would thinke it had beene more conuenient, that ſeeing we were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and vniuſtly held captiues, our Sauiour ſhould haue come vpon him with greater power, and haue reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs out of his handes without anie price: according to that ſpeech in the Goſpell;<note place="margin">Luk. 11, 21, 22</note> 
               <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his Palace, the things that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth are in peace. But when a ſtronger then he commeth vpon him, and ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him, he taketh from him all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein hee truſteth, and diuideth his ſpoiles.</hi> To this I anſwere, that our Sauiour Chriſt did not pay this price to the deuill, but to God: who had power to condemne vs, and in his iuſt iudgement had giuen vs ouer for our ſinnes, vnto the power of the deuill, as his Iailor. Now, when the King is pacified towards a priſoner that hath offended him, the Iailor hath nothing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6379:34"/>
to do to keepe him any longer in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So Gods wrath beeing appeaſed towards vs by the death of Chriſt, the deuill hath no more power ouer vs. So that our Sauiour by paying this ranſome, made ſatisfaction to God, and not to the deuill. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he offered himſelfe to God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9, 14.</note> But it may be further obiected: The ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our Sauiour Chriſt were but of ſhort continuance, for ſome fewe houres: whence then haue they that dignity and worthineſſe, to bee a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient price for our redemption? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt, that hee ſuffered moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, hauing no ſinne of his own that might deſerue death. And that made his ſufferings the more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for vs. As S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was a Lamb vndefiled, and without spot.</hi> 1 Pet. 1, 19. And againe, 2, 22. <hi>Hee did no ſinne, neither was there any guile found in his month.</hi> &amp; 3, 18. <hi>Hee ſuffered for ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt, to bring vs to God.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, Hebr. 7, 26. <hi>He was holy, harmeleſſe, vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeparate from Sinners.</hi> &amp; 9, 14. <hi>Hee
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6379:35"/>
offered himſelfe without ſpot vnto GOD.</hi> Whereunto agreeth that ſpeech of one of the Fathers,<note n="*" place="margin">Peccat iniqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But, being altogether innocent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee is the more fit to ſatiſfie for our ſinnes.

               </note> The blood of Chriſt, becauſe it was his that had no ſinne at all, was ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:6379:35"/>Secondly, the death of Chriſt was not the death of a meere man onely, though neuer ſo innocent: but of him that was true God and man. And this is that which the Apoſtle ſayeth Heb. 9, 14. that <hi>Christ thorough the Eternall Spirit, offered himſelfe without ſpot to God:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Beza. Pareus. Piſcator. Aretius</note> where, by the Eternall Spirit, is meant the Deity and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of our Sauiour, whereby hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth influence of diuine vigor to the ſacrifice of his body and blood. And in his farewell ſermon to the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he chargeth the Elders,<note place="margin">Acts 20, 28.</note> to <hi>Take heede to the Flocke, which GOD hath purchaſed with his owne blood.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 8.</note> And in another place he ſaith, that the <hi>Iewes crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not ſo to be vnderſtoode, as if GOD had any blood to be ſhed, or that the Lord of Glorie were ſubiect to ſuffering, and could bee crucified: but, becauſe of that neere Vnion and coniunction of the two Natures in his perſon; whereby, that which is proper to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, is affirmed and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the other. Hence it commeth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6379:36"/>
to paſſe, that though the ſufferings &amp; death of Chriſt were temporarie: yet they were of infinit merit, to <hi>purchaſe eternall redemption for vs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebru. 9, 12.</note> becauſe (as was ſaide before) the eternall Spirite of his Deity, gaue eternall efficacie vnto his ſacrifice: or becauſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite vigour which purgeth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, iſſued from his eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So that there is no doubt, but that Chriſt hath ſatisfied the wrath of god for vs by finite meanes. For, as the Father being infinite, was infinitely prouoked by finite ſinnes: ſo the Son of God being equall to his Father, &amp; therefore infinite, could not but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely pacifie his wrath, by his finite ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>But ſome wil ſay, Was it not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Lord to haue accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our redemption by ſome other meanes, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> of neceſſitie muſt giue his life for vs? This queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it be curious, yet it ſhall not be vnprofitable to giue an anſwer to it. We are to know therefore, that to ſpeak ſimply and abſolutely, it was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6379:36"/>
poſſible for God to haue found out a thouſand meanes of mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all of them ſhould haue bene auaileable. For, as the Angell ſaide,<note place="margin">Luke 1, 37. Math 19, 26.</note> 
               <hi>With God nothing is impoſſible, but all things are poſſible.</hi> But if we conſider the fore-knowledge and eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, then we may truely ſay, it was altogether impoſſible for man to be redeemed by any other means.<note place="margin">Auguſtine, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, <hi>&amp; others</hi>
               </note> Some of the Fathers haue inuented this witty deuiſe; namely, that the cauſe of man was from al eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in heauen: where the <hi>iustice</hi> &amp; <hi>truth</hi> of God ſtoode on the one ſide; and his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> on the other: and his <hi>wiſedome</hi> was the Iudge and vmpire.

But his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him, and defended him. In the end, his <hi>wiſedom</hi> found out a way, whereby both his <hi>iuſtice</hi> might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, &amp; his <hi>mercy</hi> might take place; namely, that the Son of God taking our fleſh vpon him, ſhould in it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

the death that was due to our ſins: that as man had treſpaſſed, ſo man might make ſatisfaction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this reſpect it was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould dye for vs. As <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> ſaith well.<note place="margin">In Mat. 26, 42</note> Therefore could not the cup paſſe from him, but hee muſt drinke of it, becauſe we could not be recouered but by his paſſion. But that wee may not bee miſtaken in this point, we are to know that there are diuers kindes of neceſſitie. Firſt, there is an abſolute neceſſity, when a thing in regarde of the nature of it, cannot be otherwiſe. Thus the Sun doth neceſſarily ſhine in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: thus the fire doeth neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burne, and the night doeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followe the day. Secondly, there is a neceſſity of conſtraint. Thus a Malefactor neceſſarily goeth to priſon, becauſe hee is forced whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee will or no. Thirdly, there is a neceſſitie in reſpect of the end: and thus armour and weapons are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for him that goeth foorth to fight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:6379:37"/>In the firſt ſence, there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer. For, (as wee haue heard before) GOD had a thouſand other wayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme man by, if it had pleaſed him. Neyther was it neceſſary in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſence, becauſe God cannot be compelled by any power or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But in the third ſence it was neceſſarie, becauſe GOD had ſo decreed and appointed it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, this was the moſt conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and neceſſarie meanes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that could bee, both in reſpect of God, and alſo in reſpect of vs.</p>
            <p>There are many Reaſons, why it was moſt conuenient in reſpect of God. As firſt, in reſpect of his truth. God had foretold in his Word, and promiſed that it ſhould bee ſo. <hi>Hee was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. 53. ver. 5. <hi>Hee was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our iniquities: the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was vppon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our Sauiour Chriſt appearing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6379:38"/>
to the two diſciples that went to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> and perceiuing that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtagger and doubt of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,<note place="margin">Lu. 24, 25, 26.</note> ſaide vnto them; <hi>O Fooles, and ſlow of heart, to beleeue all that the Prophets haue ſpoken. Ought not Chriſt to haue ſuffered theſe things, and to haue entred into his glory?</hi> And when <hi>Peter</hi> had drawne his ſword, and began to fight in his quarrell, hee telleth him that <hi>He could pray to his Father, and he would giue him more then twelue legions of Angels.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26, 53:54</note> 
               <hi>But how then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould the Scriptures be fulfilled, which ſay, that it muſt be ſo?</hi> Marke heere, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue ſaide that Chriſt muſt die; the Prophets had foretold as much, and God is alwayes true in his word, therefore it muſt bee ſo. Secondly, in reſpect of his Iuſtice, which, as wee haue heard already, did require, that the ſame nature that had offended the maieſty of God, ſhould alſo make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction. Thirdly, in reſpect of his mercy. For, ſeeing it was in his power to deſtroy all mankind, and that iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, it was an euidence of vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6379:38"/>
mercy, to make choiſe of one to be puniſhed inſtead of many. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of his wiſedome, which tempered and allayed the rigour and ſeuerity of his iuſtice, with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his mercy: ſo that in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt there was neither cruelty nor remiſſeneſſe:<note place="margin">Pſalme 85, 10</note> but as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mercy and trueth haue met together: Iuſtice and peace haue kiſſed one another.</hi> Fiftly, in reſpect of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, for the deſtroying where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he would haue his onely begotten Sonne to be put to death. Will not all men ſay, that that man beareth a deadly hatred to his enemy, that if he cannot otherwiſe come at him, will caſt a ſpeare through the ſides of his ſonne to kill him? So the Lord, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his great hatred againſt our ſins, hath wounded his owne Son to death for the aboliſhing of them. And therefore, by the way, wee ſee, how lamentable the eſtate of deſperat ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is, who knowing how the Lord hateth ſinne, wil yet notwithſtanding continue in ſinne, and <hi>drinke iniquitie

For ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we miſerable ſinners ſhould periſh, as wee had deſerued, hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his onely begotten Sonne, whom he ſo often calleth his <hi>Beloued Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 3, 17. and 17, 5. Coloſſ. 1, 13.</note> and <hi>the Sonne of his loue,</hi> or his <hi>deere Sonne,</hi> to bee crucified for vs. And therefore, our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, Iohn 3. verſe 16. <hi>GOD ſo loued the world</hi> (that is, ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſo wonderfully, ſo exceedingly) <hi>that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5, 8.</note> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out his loue towards vs</hi> (as it were, vpon a ſtage, that all the worlde may take notice of it) <hi>ſeeing that while wee were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for vs.</hi> And indeede, it was farre greater and more aboundant loue, that he <hi>spared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayeth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6379:40"/>
Rom. 8, verſe 32. then if hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed and acquitted vs without anie ſatisfaction. So that we may now worthily ſay with the Apoſtle, Ephe. 2. verſe 4. <hi>God which is rich in mercie, through his great loue wherewith he loued vs, &amp;c.</hi> There was no way in the world, whereby he could haue more manifeſted his exceeding loue vnto vs then by this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of vs. This was the moſt conuenient meanes for our ſaluation that could bee, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath worthily declared in many places,<note n="*" place="margin">De Trinit. lib. <hi>13.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> It was poſſible (ſaith hee) for GOD, to whoſe power all things are equally ſubiect, to haue found out another way of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, then the incarnation and death of Chriſt. But there neyther was, nor could bee a more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes to heale our miſerie. For, what was ſo neceſſarie to rayſe vppe our hope, and to free and ſet at libertie the mindes of poore men, being caſt downe with the condition of their mortality, from deſpairing of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6379:41"/>
immortality; as to ſhew vnto vs how highly GOD eſteemed vs, and how much he loued vs? And what could be a more manifeſt and euident token heereof, then that the Sonne of God, beeing immutably good, &amp; abiding in himſelfe that which hee was, and receiuing from vs, and for vs that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he was not, without any detriment or loſſe to his nature, was content to take part in our condition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any euill deſert of his owne, to beare our ſinnes and miſeries? &amp;c. And in another place.<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. Cap. <hi>16</hi>
               </note> Why ſhould not the death of Chriſt come to paſſe? Nay, why ſhould not the omnipotent God, letting paſſe innumerable other meanes which he could haue vſed to redeeme vs, chiefely and principally make choiſe of it; where neither anie thing was changed or diminiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Deity; &amp; by aſſuming of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſo great a benefite was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and beſtowed vpon men, that the eternall Sonne of God, being alſo the ſonne of man, ſhould pay a temporal death vndeſerued, thereby to deliuer
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6379:41"/>
vs from euerlaſting death? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note n="*" place="margin">De agone Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano.</note> They are fooles that ſay, why could not the wiſedome of GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme man otherwiſe, vnleſſe his Son ſhould become man, and be borne of a woman, and ſuffer all thoſe thinges at the hands of ſinners? To whom we ſay, he could without queſtion. But if hee ſhould haue done otherwiſe, it would likewiſe haue diſpleaſed your folly. And then he concludeth, This remedy that God hath prouided for men is ſo excellent as cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. For what pride can bee healed if it bee not healed with the humilitie of the Sonne of God? What Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe can bee cured, if it bee not cured by the pouerty of the Sonne of God? What impiety can bee helped and remedied, if it bee not helped by the charitie of the Sonne of GOD? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By this that hath beene ſpoken, is confuted that abhominable doctrine and practiſe of the Papiſts, who ioyne the afflictions of the Saints to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt: and beſides, doe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6379:42"/>
boaſt of a ſuper abundance of merites and ſatiſfactions, which do not onely profit the liuing, but are beneficiall alſo to the dead, that are in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But this is a couzening deuice of Satan, and an intollerable profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood of Chriſt, &amp; a great derogation from the merites of his paſſion. Yet they labour to proue it, by that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. 1,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1, 24.</note> 24. where he ſaith, <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reioyce in my ſufferings for you, and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodyes ſake, which is the Church.</hi> Heere (ſay they) wee ſee that the Apoſtle ſuffered for the Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That there is no ſuch ſence to be gathered out of this place, as they intend. For firſt, it is directly contrarie vnto other places of Scripture, which doe plainly teach vs, that Chriſt onely ſuffered that which was to bee ſuffered, for our ſinnes.<note place="margin">Iſai. 53, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10.</note> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>Hee hath borne our infirmities, and carried our ſorrowes; that he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6379:42"/>
for our tranſgreſſions, and broken for our iniquities, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> That <hi>the Lord laide vppon him the iniquity of vs all.</hi> That <hi>for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Gods people hee was plagued.</hi> That <hi>hee made his ſoule an offering for ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſayeth,<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 26.</note> that <hi>he appeared once to take away ſinne, by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2, 2.</note> 
               <hi>That hee is the reconciliation for our ſinnes: and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole Worlde.</hi> And our Sauiour Chriſt, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before hee gaue vp the Ghoſt, ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 19, 30.</note> Whatſoeuer was to be ſuffered for the ſinnes of men, it was fully accompliſhed, and the price of our Redemption was fully paid: and therefore, wee neede not any of the ſufferings of the Saints. Againe, if this ſence of theirs be admitted, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie groſſe abſurdity wil follow, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Apoſtle ſuffered all that was wanting; and therefore nothing now remaineth for any body elſe to ſuffer. For he ſaith, <hi>he fulfilled the reſt of</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Chriſt.</hi> Their great doctor
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6379:43"/>
               <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> though otherwiſe he fauoured the doctrine of merit: yet hee vnderſtandeth this place more ſoundly.<note n="*" place="margin">Part. <hi>3.</hi> ſum quaeſt. <hi>48.</hi> artic. penult.</note> The ſuffrings of the Saints (ſaith he) doe profit the Church, not by way of redemption, but by way of example and conſolation: according to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1, 6.</note> 
               <hi>If we be afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is for your conſolation and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And he ſaith, it is hereticall to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the contrary. And the ordinarie <hi>Gloſſe</hi> expounds it thus, <hi>I reioyce in my ſufferings for you,</hi> (that is to ſay)<note n="*" place="margin">Pro vobis. i. confirmandu in doctrina Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelij.</note> to confirme you in the doctrine of the Goſpell. And in this ſenſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſuffered that meaſure of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God in his owne counſell had appointed for him. Now, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are called the <hi>reſt of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont of Chriſt,</hi> it is not ſo to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, as though the ſufferings of Chriſt were imperfect, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were wanting in them, (for, as the Apoſtle ſaieth, By the ſhedding of his blood <hi>he obtained eternall redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion for vs</hi>) but becauſe of that ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that is betweene Chriſt &amp; a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6379:43"/>
in their ſufferings. The afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Saints go as neere him, and he is as ſenſible of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if a man <hi>ſhold touch the apple of his eye.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zachary 2, 8.</note> And therefore he ſaide to <hi>Paul,</hi> when before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion he made hauock of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9, ver. 4.</note> Our Sauiour in his owne perſon was in heauen, at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore hee was out of his reach; yet he acknowledged himſelfe to be perſecuted in his members. And this is that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith in diuers places. <hi>If we ſuffer with him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 17.</note> 
               <hi>wee ſhall be glorified with him.</hi> Whatſoeuer our ſufferings are, we doe not ſuffer alone, but Chriſt ſuffereth with vs. And in another place,<note place="margin">Philip. 3, 10.</note> hee deſireth to know the <hi>fellowſhip of his afflictions.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1, 5.</note> 
               <hi>The ſufferings of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in vs.</hi> Our ſufferings are not ours alone, but they are Chriſts as well as ours. By this that hath beene ſpoken, wee ſee the doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſufferings of the Saints, doth fall to the ground. Now wheras they boaſt of the ſuperabundance of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6379:44"/>
it is moſt blaſphemous. For the Apoſtle ſaieth plainly,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 18. <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I account</hi> (that is to ſay, hauing compared the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on both ſides, and caſt vppe my accompt, I conclude) that <hi>the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this preſent time are not worthie of the glory, which ſhall bee ſhewed vnto vs.</hi> Whereunto agreeth that ſaying of <hi>Origen,</hi>

If all our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, if martyrdome it ſelfe cannot merite our owne ſaluation: ſurely, much leſſe ſhall wee bee able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to merite ſaluation for others. As the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſalme 49, 7. <hi>A man can by no meanes redeeme his Brother; hee cannot giue his ranſome to God.</hi> Let vs therefore renounce this curſed and damnable doctrine, and ſend it backe againe to hell, from whence it came: and let vs rely vpon the all-ſufficient merites of Chriſt his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6379:44"/>
ſufferings for the ſaluation of our ſoules, aſſuring our ſelues, that <hi>Hee was made vnto vs Wiſedome,</hi>

               <hi>and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Let vs acknowledge with that bleſſed <hi>Martyr Lambert</hi> in the midſt of the fire,<note n="*" place="margin">Foxe marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol.</note> 
               <hi>None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this great price that our Sauiour hath payed for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſhould mooue vs to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſorrowe, and remorſe for our ſinnes. It is true, that the very bare conſideration of our Sauiour Chriſt his ſufferings, without any reſpect to vs, ſhould worke ſorrow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration in our hearts. For who is ſo hard-hearted, that can but reade or heare the Storie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> about to ſacrifice his innocent ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or the ſelling away of poore <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> by his moſt vnnaturall and cruell Brethren, or the fearefull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which many of the Martyres haue ſuffered and endured at the hands of cruell and bloody tyrants, &amp; not be moued to ruth &amp; compaſſion?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6379:45"/>
Nay, who can endure to behold euen notorious malefactors executed for their iuſt deſerts, without ſome ſenſe of ſorrow? For the communion and mutuall participation of nature doeth ſo affect vs, as wee thinke that part of our ſelues ſuffereth in them: yea, that very humanity that is bred with men cannot but bee troubled at the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of brute beaſts. But when wee ſhall conſider that our Sauiour ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that he ſuffered for our ſakes, and for our ſinnes: much more then ought we to greeue and ſorrow. It was ordained in the Law, that when a man brought a beaſt to the doore of the Tabernacle for a burnt Offering, he ſhould put <hi>his hand vpon the head of it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 1, 4.</note> Thereby acknowledging that hee had deſerued to die, &amp; that the beaſt was to be ſlaine for his offences. So ſhould wee acknowledge that Chriſt, was put to death, nor for anie deſert of his owne (for, as we haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he was altogether without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh) but onely for our ſinnes. When <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw the miſerable death of his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6379:45"/>
people by the peſtilence, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that his ſinne in numbering of his men was the cauſe of it, his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart was vexed within him, and with great remorſe hee cried thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord: <hi>Behold, I haue ſinned, yea, I haue done wickedly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam 24, 17.</note> 
               <hi>but theſe Sheepe what haue they done?</hi> In like manner, we haue all cauſe with bitterneſſe of heart, to cry out in this caſe: It is we Lord that haue ſinned, it is wee that haue done wickedly: as for this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambe Chriſt Ieſus, alas, what hath he done?</p>
            <p>But that we may be the better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, it ſhall not be amiſſe a litle to conſider the greeuouſneſſe of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. And that will appeare, firſt, by the generality of them, and that in diuers reſpects. Firſt, hee ſuffered of all kinds and ſorts of men. Hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Gentiles, and of the Iewes; of the Princes and of the people, of maſters and ſeruants, of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſtrangers, of male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. So hee ſuffered in all things wherein it is poſſible for a man to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6379:46"/>
He ſuffered in his friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who ſeeing him apprehended and carried away, <hi>They all forſooke him and fled.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26, 56, 58</note> Onely <hi>Peter</hi> followed him, but it was <hi>a farre off,</hi> and afterwardes moſt ſhamefully denied him.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6379:59"/>
or in deſperation, when they ſaw all things aduerſe and croſſe, did chuſe rather to dy then to indure that miſery. In a word, they hazarded their liues to procure ſafety to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or to their friends, both w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they were bound to loue. But Chriſt hath purchaſed eternall life for vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not his friends,<note place="margin">Rom 5, 10.</note> but <hi>his enemies,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith: Neither is this repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that ſpeech of our Sauior al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15, 13, 14, 15.</note> that <hi>hee gaue his life for his friends.</hi> For without Chriſt and the reconciliation that is wrought by his blood, we are the enemies of GOD: but in Chriſt wee are reconciled vnto him, and made his friends.

Chriſt died for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and he died for his friends: hee dyed for his enemies, for ſuch we wer by the corruption of our nature: and hee died for his friends, for ſuch wee were by the reconciliation which hee hath wrought.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to confirme our faith and confidence in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Surely, he that layeth downe his

life for any man, will with-hold from him nothing, though it bee neuer ſo deare, which he wil not willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow for his ſafety. But a mans life, is the deereſt and moſt precious good thing that he enioyeth. And therfore the Apoſtle reaſoneth concerning the loue of God.<note place="margin">Roman. 8, 32.</note> 
               <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but gaue him for vs all to death: how ſhall he not with him giue vs all thinges alſo?</hi> So may wee reaſon concerning the loue of Chriſt; He that ſpared not his owne life, but willingly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaue it for vs all, how ſhal he now deny vs any thing?</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, it ſhould ſtirre vs vp to loue him again, and to conſecrate our ſelues wholly vnto his ſeruice. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exhortation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>I beſeech you therefore brethren,</hi>

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:6379:60"/>Thereby giuing vs to vnderſtand, that the greateſt and ſtrongeſt reaſon why we ſhould liue to the Sonne of God is this, euen becauſe he hath loued vs, and giuen himſelf for vs. For ſo great loue and honor which hee hath done to vs, not to do the like for him again to the vttermoſt of our power, were the groſſeſt ingratitude that can bee in the worlde.

So when it is ſaide that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt died for all, wee may ſafely vnderſtand it, that he died for men of all ſorts and conditions, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, bond or free But it wil be obiected again, that our Sauior ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn 3, 16.</note>

I doe not deny, but that the death of Chriſt is ſufficient to ſaue al men; for his blood (as wee haue heard) is of infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.

            <p>This ſerueth for the reproofe of them, that thinke that all ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the death of Chriſt. It is a fearefull error where-with the deuill carried many thouſandes of poore ſoules to hell. But they ſhall finde and feele the contrarie to their woe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they preuent it by repentance.
